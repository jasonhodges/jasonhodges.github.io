was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.8.\nDevelopment server\nRun yarn start  or yarn hmr for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCommitizen\nCommitizen should be installed globally (or locally) npm install -g commitizen in order for git-cz to work.\nhttps://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nPublishing\nScripts have been set up to build the site as well as create the documentation via Compodoc. In order to create a full build and publish, run yarn publish:full.\nPushing changes on develop will kick of TravisCI. If a success pipeline is complete, Travis will deploy to master on Github and the newly updated site will be live.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nLog\nOct 9, 2019 |
