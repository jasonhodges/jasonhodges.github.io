You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nPublishing\nScripts have been set up to build the site as well as create the documentation via Compodoc. In order to create a full build and publish, run yarn publish:full.\nPushing changes on develop will kick of TravisCI. If a success pipeline is complete, Travis will deploy to master on Github and the newly updated site will be live.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning
